        "Lectures will be organised around three activities:\n1. Reading, understanding, and presenting scientific papers (Activity 1): each student\nwill pick one article from a set proposed by a teacher, and prepares a short presentation\n(15-20 minutes) to explain it to the group, contextualising it to a particular problem.\n2. Interview with researchers (Activity 2): each student selects a researcher in Toulouse\nwho works in the topic of the scientific paper chosen, and interview her/him on the latest\nfinding in her/his field, her/his motivation to become a researcher, and her/his connections\nto industry.\n3. Conceiving and writing a group position paper (Activity 2): four groups of students will\nresearch on four topics (privacy, job market, inequalities, warfare), producing each a\nposition paper and a final presentation suggesting policies to tackle the social\nconsequences of innovation in IT.\n4. Individual presentations (Activity 3): topics can be proposed by single students on the\ndiscussion platform and can be voted by the other students. Once a month the most voted\nproposal is selected and a 30 minutes individual presentation is prepared by the student\nbehind the proposal."]
